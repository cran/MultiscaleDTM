## Purpose

This package calculates multi-scale geomorphometric terrain attributes
from regularly gridded digital terrain models (DTM; i.e. elevation or
bathymetry rasters) via a specified window size.

## Install and Load Package

The package can be installed from CRAN using
`install.packages("MultiscaleDTM")` or the development version can be
installed from github using the code
`remotes::install_github("ailich/MultiscaleDTM")`. If you are using
Windows, you may need to install Rtools using the instructions found
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)). To install from
github you must already have the remotes package installed, which can be
installed using `install.packages("remotes")`

This package relies on the `terra` package for handling of spatial
raster data.

## Main Functions

### Slope, Aspect and Curvature

- `SlpAsp` calculates multi-scale slope and aspect according to Misiuk
  et al (2021) which is a modification of the traditional 3 x 3 slope
  and aspect algorithms (Fleming and Hoffer, 1979; Horn et al., 1981;
  Ritter, 1987). This algorithm only considers a subset of cells within
  the focal window, specifically the four cells on the edge of the focal
  window directly up, down, left, and right of the focal cell for the
  “rook” case and an additional four corner cells for the “queen” case.
  <img src="man/figures/SlpAsp.png" width="70%">

- `Qfit` calculates slope, aspect, curvature, and morphometric features
  by fitting a quadratic surface to the focal window using ordinary
  least squares using the equation shown below where a-f are regression
  parameters, Z is the elevation/depth, X is the east/west coordinates
  in the focal window relative to the focal cell, and Y is the
  north/south coordinates in the focal window relative to the focal cell
  (Evans, 1980; Wilson et al., 2007; Wood, 1996). The morphometric
  features algorithm has been modified to use more robust measures of
  curvature based on the suggestions of Minár et al. (2020).

### Roughness

- `VRM` - Vector ruggedness measure (Sappington et al. 2007) quantifies
  roughness by measuring the dispersion of vectors normal to the terrain
  surface. This is accomplished by calculating the local (3 x 3 cell)
  slope and aspect, and constructing unit vectors normal to each cell in
  the DTM. These unit vectors are then decomposed into their
  corresponding x, y, and z components (i.e. the x, y, and z coordinates
  of the head of the vector relative to its origin) and used in the
  following equation (note: N is the number of cells in the window). VRM
  ranges from zero to one, representing completely smooth to rough
  surfaces, respectively. .

 - `SAPA` - Calculates the Surface Area to Planar Area (Jenness, 2004).
Rougher surfaces will have a greater surface area to planar area ratio,
and perfectly smooth surfaces will have a value of 1. This is a 3D
analog to the classical “chain-and-tape” method, which calculates
roughness as the ratio of the contoured distance (chain length) and
linear distance (tape measure distance; Risk, 1972). Additionally,
planar area can be corrected for slope by dividing the product of the x
and y resolution by the cosine of slope (Du Preez 2015). Moreover, a
proposed extension to multiple scales is provided by summing the surface
areas within the focal window and adjusting the planar area of the focal
window using multi-scale slope.

    - `SurfaceArea` - Calculate the surface area of each grid cell (Jenness, 2004). This is accomplished by connecting a focal cell to its immediate neighbors to create 8 large triangles. These large triangles are then trimmed back to the extent of the focal cell using the principle of similar triangles, and then the area of those 8 smaller triangles are calculated and summed to estimate the surface area of the focal pixel. This is used within `SAPA`.

- `AdjSD`- This new proposed roughness metric modifies the standard
  deviation of elevation/bathymetry to account for slope. It does this
  by first fitting a plane to the data in the focal window using
  ordinary least squares, and then extracting the residuals, and then
  calculating the standard deviation of the residuals within the focal
  window.

<img src="man/figures/adj_sd.png" width="80%">

- `RIE` - Calculates the Roughness Index-Elevation which quantifies the
  standard deviation of residual topography (Cavalli et al., 2008). This
  measure is conceptually similar to `AdjSD` but rather than fitting a
  plane and extracting residuals for the entire focal window, residual
  topography is calculated as the focal pixel minus the focal mean. Then
  the local standard deviation is calculated from this residual
  topography using a focal filter.

### Relative Position

- `TPI` - Topographic Position Index (Weiss, 2001) is the difference
  between the value of a focal cell and the mean of the surrounding
  cells.

- `RDMV` - Relative Difference from Mean Value (Lecours et al., 2017) is
  the difference between the value of a focal cell and the mean of the
  cells in the focal window divided by the range or standard deviation
  of the values in the focal window.

- `BPI` - Bathymetric Position Index (Lundblad et al., 2006) is the
  difference between the value of a focal cell and the mean of the
  surrounding cells contained within an annulus shaped window. It is a
  modification of TPI that uses an annulus shaped focal window and
  therefore requires an inner and outer radius. For example, an annulus
  window with an inner radius of 4 cells and an outer radius of 6 cells
  would be

## Tutorial

In this tutorial we will calculate various terrain attributes using a 5
x 5 cell rectangular window. Any rectangular odd numbered window size
however could be used (see figure directly below). Window sizes are
specified with a vector of length 2 of `c(n_rows, n_cols)`. If a single
number is provided it will be used for both the number of rows and
columns. The only metric that does not follow this syntax is BPI which
uses an annulus shaped focal window which we will calculate using an
inner radius of 4 and an outer radius of 6 cells.

The annulus window for BPI can be specified in either cell units (number
of raster cells) or in map units (e.g. meters) which can be useful if
your x and y resolutions are not equal. Additionally, the function
`annulus_window` can be used to verify that you are specifying your
window correctly (NA’s are excluded cells and 1’s are included cells)
and can be directly supplied to the `w` argument in the `BPI` funtion
instead of using `radius` and `unit` arguments.

``` r
annulus_window(radius = c(4,6), unit = "cell")
