\title{Creates circular focal window}
\usage{
circle_window(radius, unit = "cell", resolution, return_dismat = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{radius}{radius of circular window}

\item{unit}{unit for radius. Either "cell" (number of cells, the default) or "map" for map units (e.g. meters).}

\item{resolution}{resolution of intended raster layer (one number or a vector of length 2). Only necessary if unit= "map"}

\item{return_dismat}{logical, if TRUE return a matrix of distances from focal cell instead of a matrix to pass to terra::focal.}
}
\value{
if a matrix of 1's and NA's showing which cells to include and exclude respectively in focal calculations, or if return_dismat=TRUE, a matrix indicating the distance from the focal cell.
}
\description{
Creates circular focal window around central pixel.
